                        This class was excellent--where have you been all my
                        life? The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable and
                        articulate. This was the first time I have taken a class
                        in a remote format, and I was delighted with it and look
                        forward to coming back to ONLC for more classes in the
                        future. I loved the fact that even though I was in a
                        class with other people, the actual physical space was
                        private and quiet and very conducive to learning! Thank
                        you.

                        This is the first time I have attended a class in this
                        format and wondered how effective it would be. It was
                        very effective and therefore I would definitely be
                        interested in attending other classes in the same
                        format. The instructor was very knowlegeable and
                        provided a wealth of information about the current
                        version, especially since the last version I used was
                        several releases ago

                        I was not sure what to expect because the class was
                        taught remotely, but I was quite impressed with the
                        entire process. The facility was very professional and
                        there were no problems with connectivity. Our instructor
                        was an expert and was very clear in his method of
                        teaching. All my questions were answered and the class
                        interaction was very good. I would take another course
                        with ONLC
